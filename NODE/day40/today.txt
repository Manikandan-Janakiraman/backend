bcrypt:
    -> Password hashing library used to securely store user Passwords in applications instead of saving the actual password in the database.
    -> bcrypt converts into a hashed format using a cryptographic algorithm.
    -> This ensures that event database is compromise attackers cannot retrieve the original Passwords
    -> Specially designed for password hashing and including building protection mechanism like salting and computation cost factors 
    -> A salting is a random values added to the password before hashing 
    -> Salt rounds 

Built in function:
    -> bcrypt is an object 
    -> Hash function - bcrypt.hash(p, sr)
            Used to converts plain passwords into a hashed version     
    -> 1 parametes - password, 2nd parametes - salting (rounds)   
    -> bcrypt.campare() 
            used during login to compare entered password and stored password to compare 
            hashed password, raw password user typing it returns boolean value only (true, false)

    -> In javascript every values has return the boolean value                           

Salt Rounds:
    Cost factors
    Higher number
