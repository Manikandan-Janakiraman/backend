Web Development:

Normal Core JS + HTML - PHP 
Libraries -> React, jquery
Framework -> angular, nextjs
Backend is express framework 
    MVCs - Model View Controller Services

Express:
    -> inversion of control(IOC) framework control the process     
    -> express js is minimal and flexible web framework, build on top of node js 
    -> USed to build an web application and rest apis 
    -> It provides routing middleware support and request, response handling in a simple and structure way.

Why Express:
    -> Node only using for small application, but it come become large application complex
    -> express simplify the server by giving building methods and middleware handling 

How it Works:

Front End: 
    -> HTTP Master (to send or receive link by using this http format)
    Request(data send or receive) -> 
    Body, Params, query, headers -> 
    POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE -> 
    response (json, text, html render (status code)) 
    Server(Local(5000, 3000), Online) -> 
    Route (API) -> 
    Controller(js core, mongodb(ORM) or sql) ->  DB Connection 
    
    
    Config
    Controller
    Middleware 
    Model
    Route 



    Pattern: HOST -> Online -> Localhost 5173

CRUD -> Create, Read, Update, Delete     

Install Express 
nodemon -> 
.env -> Environment Variable (Sensitivity Data) Do not push this env file into github or third party server, it has confidential information
        git ignorance 


Installation Commands:

    npm init -y   -> Server set (package.json) 
      Explanation:
      -y -> yes meaning 

    npm init  -> all detail information given by the user 

    npm i express nodemon --save-dev dotenv

    nodemon -> Automatic restart your server 

    --save-dev -> only for Development purpose 

    dotenv -> Environment variable file 

    package-lock.json -> Testing purpose 

    node-module -> Backend Libraries 

    for file creation: 
    echo .> server.js
    server.js or index.js 

    cls -> clear 


Folder structure:

    node_modules
    .env
    .gitignore
    package-lock.json 
    package.json
    server.js 


front end -> copy the gitignore file and paste it into Backend folder structure

package.json -> 
    "type":"module"
    "main":"server.js"
    "start":"node server.js"
    "dev":"nodemon server.js"

.env ->
    PORT=5000 

.gitignore ->
    .env     

Server.js 
    import express from 'express'

    console.log(express);

To run the process 
    -> npm run dev 

Normal Run:
    -> node server.js     



First we have convert the express into expression format 
    import express from 'express'
    import dotenv from 'dotenv'

    const app = express() // expression format 
    
    dotenv.config()
    
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000   // OR (||) operator using 

    app.listen(PORT, ()=>{
        console.log(`Server Connected successfully http://localhost:${PORT}`)
    }) 
       
       
       
Explanation:
        listen -> 2 parameter pass
