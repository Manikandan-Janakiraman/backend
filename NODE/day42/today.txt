JWT ---> Stateless authentication mechanism, digitally signed token 
JWT --->  JSON Web Tokens

It is compact self contained and secured way to tansmit information between two parties as a 
json objects.

The information  inside the token is digitally signed which means it cannot be modified without 
inviting the signature.

JWT widely used in authentication system to maintain user session securely in modern web application

A JWT token consists of three parts of separated by dots.

    Header -> Contains information about the signing algorithm 
    Payload - > User related data like user id or role, Data parse from here 
    Signature -> ensures the token has not tampered or not.

    -> These structure makes jwt secured and light weight.
    -> Server does not store session data in memory or database.
    -> Once the token generated and sent to the client.    
    -> A client send it back with every request.
    -> A server verifies each time 
    -> JWT is commonly used in REST API where front end and backend is separated 


Authentication:
    Who the user
    To validate the user     
    To check the user 
    To verify the user.

Authorization:
    Accessing the directory or files permission to give Admin, User 
    Authorization verify the identity

Installing Packages:
    npm i jsonwebtoken 

Packages:    
    npm i express nodemon dotenv cors mongoose jsonwebtoken bcrypt multer 
        mailverification    
        payment gateway 


JWT Process: 
    Sign -> Generate the token 
        Parameters (payload, secret key, options) 

    Verify Function:
        Already Generate tokens and secret key         



Hash -> compare, Hash


Token Generation:

const jwt_token = jwt.sign(
    {id:checkEmail_id, name:checkEmail.name},
    {JWT_token:process.env.JWT_SECRET_KEY }
    {expiresIn:"3hr"}
)
res.status(200).json({msg:"Login Success",token:jwt_token})
