useID :
-> Automatic Unique ID useID is a generate react hook, stayable identifier for elements inside the component.
-> Mainly designed for accessibility purpose especially to correctly connect form elements like label and inputs.
-> When reusable components render multiple times.
-> Category, post, product


 

UseTRansition :
-> It is a react hook that allows developers to marks certain state update as non urgent.
-> This is means react will prioritize to update work


useDeferredvalue:
-> react hook, used to delay updating a value until a browser is free from more urgent work.
-> search, filter, rendering, fast interaction for ui 


useImperativeHandle:
-> That allows a child component to customize what is exposed to the parent, when a ref i used.
-> Parent accessing a child throught ref.


htmlFor:
ID: focusing the input box

Debouncing & Throttling:

JS:
    -> JS
    -> Compiler
    -> Where its run
    -> show the value
    -> data type, variable 
    -> operators
    -> Conditional(If else), control statements (Loops)
    -> Hoisting, closure, function, trithy value, bugs, NAN, undefined, reference error.
    -> Array, array of objects, function(callback, closoure, return, recursion), Object (Access)
    -> ES6+ handling 
    -> DOM (Array methods, access, value (selectors), events(onclick, onchange, onsubmit), DOM Properties(Innertext, innerhtml))
    -> Form handling (array, object how to show)
        -> Local storage, session storage 
    -> Asynchronous process (Backend) (Node and Express)

REACT: 
    -> Project set 
    -> difference between js and react 
    -> VITE vs CRA 
    -> NPM, npx 
    -> node modules 
    -> component creation (closoure function)
    -> CSS, tailwindcss
    -> react router dom, link, route 
    -> use hooks concepts 
        useContext, useEffect, useState
        useMemo(value only return), useCallback(function pass), useParams 
        useID, useDeferredvalue, useImperativeHandle, useDeferredvalue, useReducer
    -> conditional, optional rendering 

    -> Redux 
    -> Projects 

Real Data handle so we use Node.js 

Node:
    -> Node js javascript Runtime environment (file path or location, path, code, logics)
    -> Used For Outside purpose or browser 
    -> Mainly for building a Server Side Function 
    -> Designed to built fast, scalable, event driven, non blocking io application
    -> Uses a Single threaded event look architecture which makes it light weight and efficient for handling multiple client request without creating multithreads.
    -> chrome v8 used to run developer outside function
    -> Used for webapi and servers 
    

Blocking IO:
    -> When one request is processing, then next request must wait until it finished. 
    
Non blocking IO:
    -> Does not wait it registered the task and move to the next request. 
    -> when the task is finished the callback handle the request. 

NODE Topics:
    Express Framework
    Server Setting (File System)
    To listen the request 
    PORT (Front end Address) (Domain or local port) 3000, 5000
    Server, Port, Route System(Way to transfer data), Middleware(request - response), Controller (Handler) Request, Response, JSON

    Core node built in node modules 


HTTP - Set the server 
File System  - FS
path System - Path 
OS System - OS 

Process - Core built in function, access the env file 

crypto, events


Type of Node Modules
    -> Built in modules (Come with node)
    -> user defined modules (We build)
    -> third party modules - express, dotenv, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS),mongoose, bcrypt, jsonwebtokens, multer (image oriented)



Express - To efficient 

MongoDB ORM - Function (Optional Relational Mapping)

URL - uniform resource locator 
HTTP - Hyer text transfer protocol 
API - application Programming interface 

REST Apis - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

Fetch - get data and give data (Dont have methods), Json parse 
axios - Automatic data conversion using get, post, put, patch
