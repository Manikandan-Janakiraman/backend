Lazy Loading

-> Loading a component only its needed not at the initial page load.
-> In large app build with react, if we load all components at once, 
    the bundle became heavy and the app becomes slow.
-> Lazy loading split the bundle and loads parts on demand.
->  Improves performance, speed, user experience.


lazy()
suspense - fallback 
            the expected component not loading we have to use fallback to view its loading 

Syntax:

const name = lazy(()=>import(path)) 



Example:

const login = lazy(()=>import("./components/Login))


<Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading...</h1>}
    <Login />
</Suspense>
